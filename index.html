                <h3><li>Understanding Probate in New York</li></h3>
           <p>Probate is the legal process of administering a deceased person’s estate. It involves proving the validity of the will in court, paying debts, and distributing the remaining assets to heirs.</p>
                <h3>The Probate Process:</h3>
                   <p><li>Filing a petition in Surrogate's Court</li></p>
                        <p><li>Notifying heirs and beneficiaries</li></p>

                         <p><li>Paying off debts and taxes</li></p>
                        
                        <p><li>Distributing the remaining property

</li></p>
 <p>This process can be time-consuming and complicated, especially when there is no will or when disputes arise. A skilled probate attorney can simplify and expedite the process.</p>
